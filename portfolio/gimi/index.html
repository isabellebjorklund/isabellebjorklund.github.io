		The name Cor comes from the latin word for “heart”. This product is made to improve the current procedure when using ECG. 
		The main problem today is that the various Electrodes must be fixed in a particular pattern on the patient, while they sit in a particular pattern on the machine. 
		In addition, they sit firmly in long cords cluttering. This makes it complicated for both the nurse and the patient. 
		COR makes the procedure easy as the product is wireless and connected to a program that can be used on a tablet.
		This makes it simpler for the nurse to gather all the information in one place, and gives access to the patient's previous results. 
		The attachment on the body is faster, since you see the order of placement by the colored pattern on the electrodes.
