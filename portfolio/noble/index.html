<p>The name Nobel comes from the swedish word for “elegant” or “worthy”. Nobel is an office armature designed by me and Sara Eriksson, in collaboration with the lighting company Zero.</p>

<p>We wanted the armature to express their design language, simplicity with a twist.
The idea behind Nobel was to make a flexible light for workspaces which could be adjusted according to the user&#39;s need. The light can be 
pointed downwards or upwards depending on what kind of work you are doing.
With a downwards pointed light, the light will be bright and spread well on your workspace, ideal for paperwork. Whereas 
you get a softer light that changes the mood in the room with a upward light. To change the light from 
one position to the other, you simply turn the knob.</p>
