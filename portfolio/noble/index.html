		The name Nobel comes from the swedish word for “elegant” or “worthy”. Nobel is an office armature 
designed by me and Sara Eriksson, in collaboration with the lighting company Zero. We wanted the armature to express their design language, simplicity with a twist. The idea behind Nobel was to make 
a flexible light for workspaces which could be adjusted according to the user's need.  The light can be 
pointed downwards or upwards depending on what kind of work you are doing. With a downwards 
pointed light, the light will be bright and spread well on your workspace, ideal for paperwork. Whereas 
you get a softer light that changes the mood in the room with a upward light. To change the light from 
one position to the other, you simply turn the knob.
