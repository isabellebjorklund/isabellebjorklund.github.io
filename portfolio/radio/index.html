Mini radio towards the company Chupa Chups. The brand is mostly famous of their lollipops that are 
sold in over 150 countries around the world. We wanted to express their playfulness and use their 
colorful palette. The idea behind the radio is to contribute a new product to their sortiment that 
amplifies to their motto “Life less serious”. The mini radio can be used as your own lollipop stand, or 
as a temporary holder, preserving the lollipop when without paper. It is designed with a fine mix of 
simplicity and extravagance, appealing to a larger target group.
